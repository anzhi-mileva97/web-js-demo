/*
Performance: Lodash is generally faster than Underscore.js, especially when working with larger datasets. This is due to Lodash's use of lazy evaluation and optimized algorithms for common tasks.

Size: Lodash is smaller in size than Underscore.js when comparing the default builds of both libraries. This can be an advantage when trying to reduce the size of your application's JavaScript bundle.

Active development: Lodash is currently under active development, while Underscore.js has not seen a major release since 2016. This means that Lodash is more likely to receive updates and bug fixes.

Modularity: Lodash is designed to be more modular than Underscore.js, which means you can import only the functions you need, rather than importing the entire library. This can help reduce the size of your codebase and improve performance.
 */


/*
There are a few scenarios where someone might choose Underscore.js instead of Lodash:

Size and performance: Underscore.js is generally smaller than Lodash, and may be a better choice for projects where minimizing the size of the codebase is a top priority. Additionally, some users have reported that Underscore.js is faster than Lodash in certain scenarios.

Familiarity: If a developer is already familiar with Underscore.js and its API, they may prefer to continue using it rather than learning a new library like Lodash.

Compatibility: If a project already uses Underscore.js and its API, it may be easier to continue using it rather than switching to Lodash and potentially introducing compatibility issues.

Preference: Finally, some developers simply prefer the syntax and style of Underscore.js over Lodash, and may choose to use it for that reason.

That being said, Lodash is generally considered to be a more modern and powerful utility library than Underscore.js, and is used in many high-profile projects and applications. Ultimately, the choice between Lodash and Underscore.js will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the developer and the project at hand.
