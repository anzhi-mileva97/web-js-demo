/*
 key concepts of functional programming in JavaScript:

Pure Functions: Functions that do not modify any data outside of their own scope. They take in one or more inputs (arguments) and return a single output (return value). They do not have any side effects, such as modifying global variables or making API calls. Pure functions are easy to reason about, test, and compose.

Higher-Order Functions: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as values. They allow for code reuse and enable the creation of more expressive and flexible code.

Closures: Functions that can access and modify variables defined in their parent scope. They can be used to create private variables and functions.

Currying: The technique of converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take a single argument.

Partial Application: The technique of creating a new function by pre-filling some of the arguments of an existing function.

Function Composition: The technique of combining two or more functions to create a new function.

Immutability: The idea that data should not be modified once it is created. In JavaScript, objects and arrays are mutable by default, but there are libraries like Immutable.js that provide immutable data structures.

Recursion: The technique of defining a function in terms of itself. It can be used to solve problems that involve repeated subtasks, such as traversing a tree or searching a list.

Declarative Code: Code that describes what the program should do, rather than how it should do it. It is often more concise and easier to read and understand.

First-Class Functions: Functions that can be treated like any other value in JavaScript. They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions.

Anonymous Functions: Functions that do not have a name and are defined inline.

Lazy Evaluation: The technique of delaying the evaluation of an expression until it is actually needed.

By using these concepts, you can write code that is more maintainable, testable, and scalable.
